        <h2>
          1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The first element that caught my attention was the video on the main
          homepage. The full-screen video provided a strong visual impact and
          immediately conveyed a professional and polished first impression of
          Rich Brown as a UX/UI designer.
        </p>
        <h2>
          2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions.
        </h2>
        <p>
          During the two-minute interaction, I performed various actions. I
          moved the mouse to observe the white line following the cursor,
          clicked the 'R' and 'B' buttons at the top and bottom of the screen,
          scrolled down to check his awards and projects, and explored the
          project details using horizontal scrolling. Finally, I clicked the '+'
          button at the bottom-left to access his social media links.
        </p>
        <h2>
          3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I spent the most time on the project detail pages. I focused on the
          screen interactions and visual details of each project to gain a
          deeper understanding of his design approach and workflow.
        </p>
        <h2>
          4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
          the experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The most common action was scrolling. I frequently scrolled through
          the project lists and details to review the content.
        </p>
        <h2>
          5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The main goal of this website is to clearly show Rich Brown‚Äôs career
          and projects, acting as a self-promotion portfolio. The key aim is to
          get visitors interested in collaborating with him or offering him job
          opportunities.
        </p>
        <h2>
          6.How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The website communicates its goal through the profile video on the
          main page and interactive project navigation. Users can scroll
          vertically to see each project, and the horizontal scroll for details
          allows effortless exploration. Hovering over project lists displays
          thumbnails to preview the next project, making it easy to understand
          his work at a glance.
        </p>
        <h2>
          7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The website seems designed for repeated visits by interviewers or
          potential collaborators. Users can return to check new projects as
          they are added.
        </p>
        <h2>
          8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The site does not appear to provide explicit features or notifications
          that encourage repeated visits. Since there are no update alerts or
          similar functions, users are unlikely to return automatically.
          However, as new projects may be added and users may want to use his
          work or interactions as a reference, it is still possible for them to
          revisit the site naturally.
        </p>
        <h2>
          9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The main page combines video and stylish typography, giving a sleek,
          eye-catching, and immersive feel similar to magazine covers or
          advertising videos.
        </p>
        <h2>
          10. What does this references communicate to you about how you should
          act when engaging with your research experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The trendy video and UI design encourage users to stay briefly and
          explore the site, naturally guiding them to check project lists. These
          elements prompt curiosity and active interaction.
        </p>
        <h2>
          11. What does this references communicate to you about how you should
          feel when engaging with your research experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The magazine-like main page and stylish typography stimulate curiosity
          and immersion. The balanced visual elements and interactions provide
          comfort while making site exploration enjoyable.
        </p>
        <h2>
          12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part frustrating?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Overall, there was little frustration, but occasional lag due to many
          interactive media elements was slightly inconvenient. And, the '+'
          button uses text (BE, LI, IG) for social links, which could be more
          intuitive with icons.
        </p>
        <h2>
          13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part satisfying?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The most satisfying aspect was the project navigation. After viewing a
          project, the next project list appears smoothly, and hovering shows a
          thumbnail, making exploration visually comfortable. The changing
          background colors for each project help maintain focus, and the
          overall interaction design is carefully crafted and impressive.
